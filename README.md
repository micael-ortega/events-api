# REST API

## About me

First I want to know how to ask questions that drives people wondering about where does this comes from or where it's going to take me, why it's so relevant?  I want to know how to effectivly ask questions.

## About the repository

This repository" contains a simple REST API. Indeed a great place to start to touch ground, especially if you love the fascinating world web services.

Just following the tutorials from [https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/]() and asking to ChatGPT where certain things comes from, so I can study and learn the foundation from the language to in the near future create more elaborated APIs.

#### Side notes

~~After writting this README file I realized that some of variables and functions declared here looks weird because it blends Portuguese and English words, sometimes at the same declaration.~~

My work on making this source code not look weird by mixing idioms on declaring variable so far seems to be done.

> yesterday I did not make a commit

> There is just this thought

> not decades

> There are things in life that will take time

> So I'm taking mine and enjoying progress
