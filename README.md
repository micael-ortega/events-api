# REST API

## About me

First I want to know how to ask questions that drives people asking themselves where does this comes from or where it's going to take me, why it's so relevant?  I want to know how to effectivly ask questions.

## About the repository

This repository" contains a simple REST API. Indeed a great place to start to touch ground, especially if you love the fascinating world web services.

Just following the manuals and asking to GPT where certain things comes from, so I can study and learn the foundation and in the near future create more elaborated APIs.

#### Side notes

After writting this README file I realized that some of variables and functions declared here looks weird because it blends Portuguese and English words, sometimes at the same declaration.
